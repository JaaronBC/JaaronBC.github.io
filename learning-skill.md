As a complete beginner to Typescript I found that it is easier to learn than the previous languages that I learned. I have found that learning languages has gotten easier with each language that I have learned. When I first started the ICS program at UH Manoa I felt completely out of my depth, everyone around me seemed to know what they were doing but I didn't understand anything that was being taught. Learning is a skill that you need to develop and the only way to get better at it, is by continuing to learn. 

Another skill that I found to need development is working under pressure, during practice WoDs and the first WoD of my software engineering class, I found I work significantly worse when under pressure. I found myself forgetting very basic things, for example, I forgot that I could Copy and Paste. I will continue working on this skill throughout my entire life until I get better at it.
