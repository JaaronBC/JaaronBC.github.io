When I first started to design a website, I used raw HTML and CSS. I found the process to be tedious because I how many things that I had to edit to create the website that I desired. During my Software Engineering class, we were introduced to the concept of UI frameworks. Using frameworks streamlined my website design process by giving me access to classes that I would have had to spend hours editing to get right with raw HTML. For software developers, using frameworks could speed up your development process by having you work more efficiently with your time and creating more consistent look to your designs.
### Efficiency
With raw HTML, I had to create UI elements from scratch which slowed down my development process. Each element had to be edited individually to get it to look the way I wanted. However with the UI framework I used, I was able speed up my development time due not having to create each element I want from the ground up. Instead of going through a complicated proccess of trial and error to get the page to look right, it simplifies that proccess to give you a more efficient work environment

### Consistent look
While using a framework, your designs will be given a more consistent look due to the tools given my the framework. This will help you if your websites require more than one page, so that every page has has a consistent UI throughout the website. With a framework, creating a consistent image of your website is easier because using the tools provided give you a more structure to work with.

### Conclusion
As I got used applying a framework to HTML and CSS, I had an easier time designing a UI due to the tools that they provide. My time was made more efficient to create more attractive and consistent UI's.
