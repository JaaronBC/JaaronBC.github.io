When I first started writing code to follow the coding standards, I found it to be annoying and hard to follow. But as I kept writing I realized that following the coding standards will get more helpful as time goes on. I have realized two things that the readibility of my code and my ability to deal with errors has improved, resulting in my efficiency as a coder increasing
## Readibility
In terms of the readability of my code, I have found that my code is more easily read by me. This will help not only me but people that I will work with in the future. It will help me and others navigate my code to more easily find errors, leading to an increase of my efficiency as a coder. It is easier to read because I now have a more consistent writing style that makes it easier for others to learn how to sift through my code. It also improves my ability read others code if they follow the same standards, because I learning how to read my own code that has been held to the standard.
### Dealing with Errors
When it comes to dealing with errors, I find myself catching mistakes earlier on so that I have to deal less errors overall. By following the coding standard, I am avoiding many habits that would have caused errors.

##### Conclusion
Coding standards have helped increase my efficiency as a coder by holding me to a more consistent writing style. The readability of my code has increased which has helped with my ability to deal with errors.
