As a complete beginner to Typescript, I found that it is easier to learn than the previous languages that I learned. I have found that learning languages has gotten easier with each language that I start to learn. When I first started the ICS program at UH Manoa, we were learning Java and I felt completely out of my depth, everyone around me seemed to know what they were doing but I didnâ€™t understand anything that was being taught. It took me until later in the semester to grasp some of the key concepts needed to succeed in the class. Given how much I struggled that semester with learning Java, I was dreading the next classes having to take the next classes which were moving to new languages like C++ and Python.

However, I found that that learning those languages did not come with as much difficulty as the first one. I found that I was focusing on areas that I found the be crucial when learning Java and that I was picking things up faster

Learning is a skill that you need to develop and the only way to get better at it, is by continuing to learn.

Another skill that I found to need development is working under pressure, during practice WoDs and the first WoD of my software engineering class, I found I work significantly worse when under pressure. I found myself forgetting very basic things, for example, I forgot that I could Copy and Paste. I will continue working on this skill throughout my entire life until I get better at it.
