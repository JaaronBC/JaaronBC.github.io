### Introduction
AI is a double-edged sword. When used correctly it can be a powerful tool that will be of great benefit to you. It can make you more efficient at coding, it can show you the answers to questions you have instantly. I myself use Github’s Co-pilot to finish coding lines so that I do not have to type out the whole line. However, double-edged swords cut both ways, if not used correctly you can hurt yourself in the long run by not monitoring how you are using AI.
### Personal Experience with AI:
In ICS 314, I have used AI more than I have than in classes I have taken before. I used it to make myself more efficient in my work and learn skills in application that I have never used before such as Supabase and NextJS. I personally don’t use AI for creative purposes such as essays, as I feel that it hinders creativity.
#### Experience WODs 
During experience WODs, I used AI to find out how to do things that I did not understand. I would then practice the skills that I learned through to prepare myself for the in class WODS
#### In-class Practice WODs
During practice WODs, I did not use AI to see if I learned the skills I needed from the experience WoDs 
#### In-class WODs
During In-class WoDs, I did not use AI as it would slow me down to look up answers during the WoD’s 
#### Essays
I did not use AI during essays as I feel it slows me down and have less creativity in my thoughts
#### Final project
I used AI to find error that I did not understand as I was unfamiliar with the applications such as NextJS and Supabase.
#### Learning a concept / tutorial
#### I often used AI for learning concepts as it summarizes information, however I felt that if I used it too often it would hinder my learning
#### Asking or answering a smart-question
I research google first, then AI, and if I could not find a solution I would ask a smart question in discord or in class
#### Writing code
While writing code, I used Github Copilot to finish lines that it already knew so that I did not have to type out the whole thing. This made me more efficient in my work.
#### Quality assurance 
When doing quality insurance, I would use AI to figure out problems I could not solve, as an example: there was a problem with authentication between Supabase and our project, and I used it as I was unfamiliar with Supabase
### Impact on Learning and Understanding:
I believe that AI both helps and hinders how we learn things. By having answers so readily available we lose the experience of trial and error which builds more on our ability to recognize problems. It helps as a starting point to get you pointed in the right direction but if used too much I feel that it hurts you more in the long run.
### Practical Applications:
In terms of the practical applications of AI, I believe that AI can a helpful support tool for coders, such as the line finishing of Github Copilot. And 
### Challenges and Opportunities:
Challenges I faced during 314, were trying not to use AI to solve all my problems. When faced with a frustration I would have to try hard not to instantly look up the solution and try to solve it for myself.
### Comparative Analysis:
I believe that AI, could be used as a helpful way to summarize information so that they know where to go into more detail elsewhere. By getting answers instantly, students could lose out ot valuable problem-solving experience that comes with trial and error.
### Future Considerations:
I believe that in the future AI can be used as a guide for students who are struggling with concepts but must be used in moderation to enhance engagement and practical skill development.
### Conclusion:
In conclusion, AI is a helpful tool that can also cut the user if not careful. If a student relies on AI too much it could result in the student losing valuable problem-solving experience and knowledge.
