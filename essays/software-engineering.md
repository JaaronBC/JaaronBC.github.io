  Efficiency is important. Learning how to do things quicker and easier is one of the many things you pick up on as you gain more experience in your work. You learn skills to apply to create a more efficient work environment. In working in Software Engineering, I have learned several things that can be applied to projects unrelated to software engineering to create more efficient workspaces. Coding Standards and Design Patterns concepts can be applied to many other projects and understanding the Ethics of your work can help you engage with your work in a more productive manner.
### Coding Standards
Coding standards are a set of rules that a coder must follow when creating their code. This ensures that their code has a consistent look which makes it easier to read and help maintain their code. If applied to everyone in a group project, the coders in the group will have an easier time reading each other’s code. Coding Standards are an important concept for creating an environment that’s more efficient to sort through and can be applied to other projects not related to software engineering. When working with others it is important to use common language that everyone knows so that no one is confused and on the same page on all things. By applying the concepts of coding standards to your projects you can create a more efficient environment.
### Design Patterns
	Design patterns are a concept in software engineering that software engineers to solve common problems by applying templates of solutions that have been used to solve these problems before. This helps coders be more efficient with their work as it allows them to reuse a solution for problems they frequently tackle and avoid recreating the same solution over and over for different problems. Design patterns work not just for coding but for many other projects as well. As an example of this, you just have to look outside: Design Patterns can also be applied to architecture, houses in similar areas use similarly designed rooves because they are the most efficient for the environment that they are in. Architects don’t have to calculate the best possible rooves because they can use example that have been tried before. By applying design patterns to your projects, you can be more efficient with your work.
### Ethics in Software engineering
	One thing that I have never really thought of until working on software, is the ethics of my own work. Do I want to create a code that can steal someone’s data or even track people’s location? By thinking on the ethics of my work, I have become more engaged with what I am creating and how it can be used. By thinking on the ethics of your projects, and the work you do is something you can be proud of, you can be more committed to your projects. If you work with many people who believe in the ethics of your projects, you can create a more efficient workspace for your group.
### Conclusion
  Having an efficient workspace is important when working. Many people will be looking to you to be faster with the work you do and your engagement. In my experience with software engineering, I found that Coding Standards, Design Patterns, and Ethics can be applied to other workplaces and not just software engineering. By using these concepts, we can create a more efficient and communicative workplace.
