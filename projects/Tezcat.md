Tezcat is a roguelike bullet hell  game developed by the Game Dev at UH Manoa club in the fall 2024 semester. This semester, we were to build a game around a theme and "Temptation" was chosen. The objective of the game was to collect as much treasure as possible and make your way through the floors. However, there was a catch, each piece of treasure you carry made your character slower making it harder to dodge attacks.

During this semester, I was on the coding team which I had not done in Unity before. In the coding group, we are each assigned task to complete over the course of the semester. The task that I was assigned was creating the Main Menu. During this process, time management and communication was the key to success, because if one person is behind in their task the whole project could get held up.

During this project, I learned alot about team communication and Unity. The game was a step up in difficulty than the last one because it included procdural generation, but it was fun to learn about what goes into that.
